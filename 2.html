                            Masashi Kishimoto was born in Okayama Prefecture,  
                            Japan on November 8, 1974, as the older identical twin
                            of Seishi Kishimoto. His home was close to Hiroshima where
                            his grandfather originated. Kishimoto's grandfather often 
                            told him about stories of war and how it was related to 
                            grudges. During his childhood, Kishimoto showed interest in 
                            drawing characters from the anime shows he watched, such as 
                            Dr. Slump's Arale and Doraemon's titular protagonist.
